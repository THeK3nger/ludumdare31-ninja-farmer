========================

My (late) entry for LudumDare 31 and "A Game a Month - December 2014"

## The Game

**Ninja Farmer** is a small casual game in which a farmer have to hit the chicken in order to score as 
much points (eggs?) as possible in 30 seconds. There are some _dexterity tricks_ in order to boost your score :

 * **Bounces**: To hit the chicken after bouncing on the screen border increase the score multiplier.
 * **Non-Stop-Shoot**: Shooting the farmer before it stops provide a fixed amount of bonus score.
 * **Combo**: To hit the chicken multiple times with a single shoot increase the score multiplier.

Thatâ€™s it. It is not a novel gameplay or a complex one. It is just a "anti-stress" game no more complicated than the
arcade mode in Fruit Ninja. 

## What is missing

THe game is highly incomplete. Unfortunately I have little artistic skills for graphic. Also the gameplay could be improved but the month was too short. :P

## Other info

A complete postmortem on the game is on [my website][1].
